# Abe's List Job Board

A job board with functionality for creating jobs, applying for jobs, uploading job seeker information, and viewing job applications

## Overview

This is a back-end web app built with Node.js, JSX, Express, and CSS. The job board can be viewed without logging in, but logging in as an job seeker or employer adds extra functionality. For job seekers, information such as resume and skills can be saved for individual users. Job seekers can also apply for jobs on the board, with information prefilled from their profile. Employers can add jobs, and then edit and delete the ones that they created. There is a "My jobs" page, that shows only the jobs that individual employer created. They can view applications from job seekers, with a score for how many matching skills are present. Employers cannot modify jobs they did not create, nor can seekers. Applications can only be viewed by the employer who created the job, and employers cannot apply.
